## Introduction
* This is a *two-player* game where there are a certain number of stacks of candies. 
* Each stack contains certain number of candies. 
* The stacks are arranged in non-decreasing order from left to right based on the number of candies in each stack. 
* Let the two players be named as Tom and Jerry. For every continuous subsequence of candies stacks, Tom and Jerry will play game on this subsequence of candies stacks, Tom plays first, and they play in turn. 
* In one move, the player can choose one of the stacks and remove at least one candy from it keeping in mind the non-decreasing order of the candies stacks which needs to be maintained. The last person to make a valid move wins.
* We need to find the continuous subsequences of candies stacks that will make Tom win if both of them play optimally. The number of candies of each stack will be recovered after the game ends for each subsequences.

## Research
* Combinatorial games are generally two-person games with perfect information and no chance moves (no randomization like coin toss is involved that can effect the game). 
* These games have a win-or-lose or tie outcome and determined by a set of positions, including an initial position, and the player whose turn it is to move. 
* Play moves from one position to another, with the players usually alternating moves, until a terminal position is reached. 
* A terminal position is one from which no moves are possible. Then one of the players is declared the winner and the other the loser. 
* Or there is a tie (Depending on the rules of the combinatorial game, the game could end up in a tie. 
* The only thing that can be stated about the combinatorial game is that the game should end at some point and should not be stuck in a loop.
